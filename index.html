        About Me
      </h1>
      <hr class="marginthing"/>
      <p class="marginthing">From as long as I can remember I have been working. Raised by two immigrants from Vietnam I am one out of six children. I grew up in Philadelphia where my parents owned a corner store. 
        Ever since I was able to do basic arithmitic I was working the cash register. As soon as I was strong enough to lift products, I was stocking shelves. Working at a such a young age has instilled a strong work ethic. I honestly can't imagine life not working. I am currently attendding UCF's Full Stack developer bootcamp. I will be updating this website as I learn more.

      <p class="marginthing">
          Growing up I was always interested in computers and built my first computer when I was 15 after getting my first part time job at the local library. 
          From there, I was an intern at the local Children's Hospital doing basic web design, tech support and student development. I used my intern experience to springboard myself into a position at Lockheed Martin as an IT Apprentice at the age of 16.
          I have been climbing the IT Career ladder ever since. I now currently work at Fedex as a Linux System Administrator with hopes to become a developer in the near future.  
          I am also founder of a startup named ADIGEE where we have streamlined the process for local businesses to cross advertise with each other.
